What neighborhoods seem to be the most popular?

Let's define popularity the neighborhood listings that have a high rate of monthly review.

```
Select neighbourhood, AVG(reviews_per_month)
FROM Portland
group by neighbourhood
order by AVG(reviews_per_month) DESC;
```
Parkrose looks to be the most popular neighborhood with 4.806875 reviews per month



What time of year is the cheapest time to go to your city? 

```Select date, avg(price)
FROM calendar
where
	available = "t"
group by date
order by avg(price) asc;```

This takes a new data set calendar. First the price is changed to numeric and truncated the "$". 
Second the above query groups all listings by day and averages the price of all available listings.
The output shows that "2018-10-02"	"102.798631893972" is the average cheapest day of the year.



What about the busiest?

```Select date, count(available)
FROM calendar
where
	available = "t"
group by date
order by count(available) desc;```

This query groups all listings by date and counts if they are available for booking. The busiest day is "2018-12-11"	with "3302" available listings.
